    **Cookies**

    BlockScore uses cookies to make interactions with its websites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the BlockScore’s websites, a cookie is sent to your computer.

    **Web Beacons**

    BlockScore uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about customers and visitors’ usage of the BlockScore’s websites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the Web beacon. For example, BlockScore may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s websites. BlockScore uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s websites and email communications.

    **IP Addresses**

    BlockScore contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete services and customer solutions described in “How we use your information.” Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of BlockScore and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for BlockScore. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. BlockScore will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, subpoena, or local law.

    BlockScore or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired. If such a combination or acquisition occurs, BlockScore will make every reasonable effort to notify you in the event we share with the merging or acquiring entity some or all of your personal information to continue serving you.

    BlockScore may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s websites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. BlockScore is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

    BlockScore posts a list of customers and testimonials on the Company’s websites that contain information such as customer names and titles. BlockScore obtains the consent of each customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

8. **Access to and accuracy of your information**

    BlockScore strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain customer data accuracy.

9. **Keeping your information secure**

    BlockScore is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, BlockScore has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

    We have up-to-date physical safeguards, such as secure areas in buildings; electronic safeguards, such as passwords and encryption; and procedural safeguards, such as customer authentication procedures to prevent ID theft.

    We restrict access to information about you to only those employees and associates who need to know that information to provide services to you.

    We carefully select and monitor outside service providers, such as mail vendors, who have access to our business information, and we require them to keep it safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do.

    We train our employees on these security procedures, and we conduct regular audits to check on compliance with the procedures.

10. **Changes to this Statement**

    If there are updates to the terms of the BlockScore’s Privacy Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.
